About Me


I am a 2nd year undergraduate student pursuing my degree in 
Computer Science Engineering from Amrita School of 
Engineering, Kerala, India. Apart from academics, I am 
avidly interested in contributing to Open Source software. 
Also, I am an active member of ​ FOSS@Amrita​  which is an Open 
Source club of my university. My special interest lies in 
developing for android and was really fascinated by the 
idea of developing cool apps. I have contributed to some Open 
Source organizations and aiming to do more. I have worked with 
firebase and have basic knowledge of integrating with RESTFUL Web 
services in android. I am an ever learner and keen to learn 
and explore new technologies.
